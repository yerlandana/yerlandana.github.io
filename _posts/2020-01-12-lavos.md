Lavos is a service that allows car owners to book car wash services online. We save car owners time.
At this time, you can book a visit to the car wash, select the desired washer and save and transfer in advance information about your car. The story of your trips to the car wash saved in the application.
In the future we plan to add a car wash card, chat with a car wash manager, bonus system and online payment.
