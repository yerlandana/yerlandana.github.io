## Introduction

  It's my first project, where our instructor gave me a dataset of 'XYZ'
shoe company. This company's sale have been decreasing since 2018, and they
want to figure out what kind of factors positively affect to sale and
what kind factors on the other hand, decrease company's profit.
  I would use R programming language and libraries: Dplyr, Ggplot2, Lubridate,
Knitr, Reshape2, DT, Rpart, DMwR, rpart.plot. Source of code linked [here](https://github.com/yerlandana/sales/blob/master/unilever.Rmd).
