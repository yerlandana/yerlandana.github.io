## 1. What is Sequence?

![photo1](/seq/intro.png)

Imagine that you are busy at your work and have chaotic daily routine.
But you have a SOMEONE to take care of. For example, Grandma.
And to help you manage the treatment of your Grandma, Sequence is created!

Smart pillbox with a mobile app that enables anyone to monitor the regimen of patient from anywhere. A device notifies when the time comes by audio and visual signals, and with special sensors detects the action of taking or not taking. The caregiver receives a notification if patient took a pill or not.

## 2. Project has 2 main parts:

### Hardware
    Software real-time database in *Firebase* is a bridge between them. So, first of all, we searched and drew the most convenient prototype of the Sequence - is the square model, to make taking and controlling medications easier.

### Software
    The sequence app is for CAREGIVER, where the user can set the reminder. When the time comes, Sequence hardware receives that command. As a result, the buzzer starts to buzz and LED switches on. After the patient takes a pill, he should manually press the Done button.
